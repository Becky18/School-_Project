On International coastal cleaning day, Students of Ryan International School across Mumbai cleaned Versova Beach, along with Afroz Shah, Champion of the Earth on Saturday morning, intending to clear sands of trash and restore the beach to its original look.

With such a vision, Ryan International School has always been endeavouring to groom its students to become socially responsible adults by engaging them in various activities.
While the entire nation celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi this October, Ryan International School, in collaboration with Nickelodeon, participated in an environmental awareness campaign – ‘Ek Tree Kare Pollution Free’. The campaign was a week-long initiative as a part of Daan Utsav (Joy of Giving Week). 150 students from three branches of Ryan International Group of Institutions – Kandivali, Goregaon and Malad, took part in it. Led by Nicktoon Dora the explorer, they planted 350 Ashoka saplings near Jogeshwari East Railway station.
Ryan International School has been well-known for creating social and environmental awareness among its students on campus and off campus. It was also recognised by the Guinness World Records for participating in the world’s largest charity donation for the needy.
Things are best learned by doing and engaging students in initiatives like these, where the young minds can understand their social responsibilities better. “The Ryan Group is pleased to associate and partner with Nickelodeon and Western Railway. We are happy to be a part of this wonderful initiative. This gave students an opportunity to understand their social responsibility and encourage them to take an interest in conserving and improving the environment. This endeavour resonates with the vision of our Chairman, Dr. A F Pinto – Each one. Plant one,” said Anjali Bowen, Principal of Ryan International School, Kandivali.
It is the responsibility of schools to inculcate value-based education to transform the young students into responsible citizens. And by kindling empathy in students towards social issues through various initiatives, Ryan International School has set itself apart in the education sphere.</p>
